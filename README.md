# Tesla and GameStop Stock Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes historical stock prices and revenue data for **Tesla (TSLA)** and **GameStop (GME)** using **Python**. The data is extracted using `yfinance` and web scraping techniques with `BeautifulSoup`, and visualized using `Plotly`.

## Project Objectives
- Extract Tesla and GameStop stock data using `yfinance`.
- Scrape Tesla and GameStop revenue data from the web.
- Create interactive visualizations to compare stock prices and revenue trends.
- Build a dashboard for financial analysis.

## Technologies Used
